An IoT Posture-Enhancing Wearable Device

Project Description

This project is a capstone design system developed as part of the requirements for a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Engineering. It integrates IoT technology to create a posture-enhancing wearable device. The system consists of both hardware and software components:

Hardware: The device uses an ESP32 microcontroller connected to five MPU6050 accelerometer and gyroscope sensors, five flat DC vibration motors for haptic feedback, and additional electronic components. The firmware is programmed in C++ using the Arduino IDE.

Software: A web application for monitoring and analyzing posture data. This application is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript (ES modules), and Firebase Realtime Database.

The device aims to improve posture by providing real-time feedback and tracking posture history via a user-friendly interface.
